In the first day of my practice is learnt how to use the function: put and printf to print in C Programming. The put() is used to print mainly strings while the printf() prints both strings and varaibles.
Also used the write(). It writes data from a buffer declared by the user to a given device, such as a file.
Also practiced using the sizeof(). This function gives the sizeof of a string and variables.
